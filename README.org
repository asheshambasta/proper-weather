ProperWeather lets you obtain basic weather information using [[https://openweathermap.org][OpenWeatherMap]].

Proper weather provides 2 ways of interacting with it:
1. As an Xmobar plugin: https://xmobar.org/#user-plugins
2. As an executable. 

Currently, just getting weather using the lat-lon values are supported. 

As an executable, one can either pass all the arguments to it or use =-C= to refer to a configuration file. The configuration file is just a text blob form with a value =PWeather= can be read. 
Example: 
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
PwLatLon { _pwAlias  = "<SomeAlias>"
          , _pwApiKey = "<YourApiKey>"
          , _pwLat    = 12.12
          , _pwLon    = 12.12
          , _pwRate   = 10
          }
#+END_SRC

At the time of writing, the Alias and rate values are not used in executable mode. 

One can also use the executable use =Com= from =xmobar= to execute arbitrary commands: 

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell 
Run Com "proper-weather" ["-C", "/path/to/conf"] "SomeAlias" 3000 -- will refresh every 5 mins.
#+END_SRC
                    

** Current limitations 

The plugin is quite basic at this point and I wrote this in anger. 
- Only supports lat-lon values for weather data 
- The outputted weather data is pretty basic
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  proper-weather -C ~/.proper-weatherrc                                130 ↵
  5.0℃, FL: 0.56℃, Clouds/overcast clouds
  #+END_SRC
- Cleanup required to overcome the need of alias and rate values for executable
  - These values are not needed from the user, but dummy values are provided anyway.
